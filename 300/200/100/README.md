# 100 - Three-Act Structure

Plot and structure go hand-in-hand, but where the **plot** is unique to the writer's creation, the **structure** is a pattern that, in a reader's subconcious, sets up expectations for how a stiry's sequence of events will unfold - even if they don't realize it in the moment.

Aristotle was the first recorded story structure theorist, suggesting stories have a beginning, middle, and end. The so-called **Three-Act Structure**.
