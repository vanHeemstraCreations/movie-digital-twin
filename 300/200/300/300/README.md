Let's break this arc down, analyzing the rise and fall of the **success** versus **failure** value throughout the key moments in our story:

## 100 - Exposition

See [README.md](./100/README.md)

## 200 - Inciting Incident

See [README.md](./200/README.md)

## 300 - Rising Action

See [README.md](./300/README.md)

## 400 - Dilemma

See [README.md](./400/README.md)

## 500 - Climax

See [README.md](./500/README.md)

## 600 - Resolution (also known as Denouement)

See [README.md](./600/README.md)

Notice how the story moves from *virtually no chance of death* to *death almost a certainty* to *the resolution*, where survival seems even more precious because of how close the protagonist came to death.

The story moves the value from the positive form to the negative, and depending on the value, back again. The story's arc is creatd through this rise and fall moment.

This same story arc can be used to tell a love story, a performance story, or even a coming-of-age story. The arc stays the same, but the value being represented by the arc changes.

**Each plot must have its own arc.**

**Short stories **(like our story)** only have one arc**. If you're writing a short story, it only has one arc. And usually that arc will only have one or two movements.
