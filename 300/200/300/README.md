# 300 - Story Arcs Can Also Fit Three-Act Structure

The three-act structure combines perfectly with story arcs, allowing felxibility in terms of the arc you're trying to create while also providing a structure that flows with the reader's expectations.

While this is not a law, commonly twenty-five percent of the arc is in the first act, fifty percent is in the second act, and the rest of the story fits into the final twenty-five percent, the final act.
