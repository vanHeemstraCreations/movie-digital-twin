# 600 - 2 Tips About How to Use These Plot Types

How do you actually write a book with these plot types in mind? Follow these two tips:

## First, Know Your Values

Bad books, stories that don't work, don’t know what their values are.

Or they’re trying to have every single value possible.

You can’t do that if you want to tell a great story. You have to choose! If you want to master the type of story you're trying to tell, start with finding the story's value.

Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/KoetV7uMRas) that shows how one author figured out their plot type by diving into the value at the center of their story.

## Second, Focus on Conflict Between Values

You've heard your stories need conflict, but that doesn't mean more arguments and car chases.

The kind of conflict your stories need more of is between values, and the way to master any type of story is to put the story's main value in conflict with its opposite.

If you're writing an **adventure** story, that means you need to have life and death moments.

If you're writing a **thriller**, you need to have moments of life vs. fate worse than death.

If you're writing a **love** story, you need to have as many moments of negative love, of anger, disillusion, and even hatred, as you do love.

If you're writing a **sports** story, there have to be as many moments of near failure, or actual failure, as there are of success.

If you're writing a **coming-of-age** story, then you need to include moments where the growing maturity of the character is put into conflict with its opposite, immaturity.

And finally, if you're writing a **temptation** or **morality **story, then you need moments of temptation—where the character genuinely considers if they should take actions they know are wrong because of how it could benefit them or solve a greater problem.
