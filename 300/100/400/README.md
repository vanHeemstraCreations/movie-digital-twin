# 400 - Types of Stories, Plot Types

If you take them a step further you can take these value scales and map them to different types of stories—or plot types. Here's how it works:

- **Life vs. Death**: Adventure, Action Stories
- **Life vs. Fate Worse than Death**: Thriller, Horror, Mystery Stories
- **Love vs. Hate**: Romance/Love Stories
- **Accomplishment vs. Failure**: Performance/Sports Stories
- **Maturity vs. Immaturity**: Coming of Age stories
- **Right vs. Wrong**: Temptation/Morality Stories

These plot types transcend literary genre. You can have a sci-fi love story, a historical thriller, a fantasy performance story, a mystery romance story, or even a young adult adventure story. (For more, check out [my guide on literary genres here](https://thewritepractice.com/literary-genres/).)

**NOTE**: Don't mistake types of stories with genre. Plot types transcend genre. 

Your story’s plot type will determine much of your story: the scenes you must include, the conventions and tropes you employ, your characters (including protagonists, side characters, and antagonists), and more.

Now that we've looked at an example, let's break down each of the ten main story types and talk about how they work.

Each of these plot types has typical archetypes for their inciting incidents and main event/climax. While you can certainly tweak or even re-work these archetypes, it's best to understand how they work and ensure that your new version of the event can bring out as much of the conflict as the typical method.

These ideas are not new, and I also have to acknowledge a huge debt to the story theorists who have gone before me, especially Blake Snyder, author of [Save the Cat](https://www.amazon.com/Save-Last-Book-Screenwriting-Youll/dp/1932907009/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=save+the+cat&qid=1633098365&sr=8-1); Robert McKee, author of [Story](https://www.amazon.com/Story-Substance-Structure-Principles-Screenwriting/dp/0060391685/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=story+Robert&qid=1633098423&sr=8-1); and Shawn Coyne, author of [Story Grid](https://www.amazon.com/Story-Grid-What-Good-Editors/dp/1936891352/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=story+grid&qid=1633098399&sr=8-1).

Bonus Type: Combine Them!

While all great stories are driven by values and the conflict between them, many stories combine plot types and/or value scales in unique ways, creating new plot types of their own.

Often this approach works best with either longer works, epics that combine many arcs into one story, or shorter works, like short stories, which may not contain all the elements of longer, more established plot types.

However, combining or rearranging plot types is considered advanced. Consider before you attempt to come up with your own completely unique plot type, especially if you are a new writer, as you risk the story not working or getting lost in the plot and failing to finish.

Remember: working with an established plot type requires just as much creativity and flair for coming up with dramatic situations as invention your own.

## Subtypes

While most popular stories will fit within the ten plot types above, you could also get more specific by exploring subtypes.

Subtypes are more specific plots with unique conventions, tropes, and characters. Examples of subtypes include revenge plots, a subtype of action plots; heist plots, a subplot of adventure stories; or obsession love stories.

Most stories that work will fall somewhere into the above plot types, and all stories that work will fall into the six value scales.
