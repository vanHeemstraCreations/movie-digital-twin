# 400 - Types of Stories, Plot Types

If you take them a step further you can take these value scales and map them to different types of stories—or plot types. Here's how it works:

- **Life vs. Death**: Adventure, Action Stories
- **Life vs. Fate Worse than Death**: Thriller, Horror, Mystery Stories
- **Love vs. Hate**: Romance/Love Stories
- **Accomplishment vs. Failure**: Performance/Sports Stories
- **Maturity vs. Immaturity**: Coming of Age stories
- **Right vs. Wrong**: Temptation/Morality Stories

These plot types transcend literary genre. You can have a sci-fi love story, a historical thriller, a fantasy performance story, a mystery romance story, or even a young adult adventure story. (For more, check out [my guide on literary genres here](https://thewritepractice.com/literary-genres/).)

**NOTE**: Don't mistake types of stories with genre. Plot types transcend genre. 

Your story’s plot type will determine much of your story: the scenes you must include, the conventions and tropes you employ, your characters (including protagonists, side characters, and antagonists), and more.

Now that we've looked at an example, let's break down each of the ten main story types and talk about how they work.

Each of these plot types has typical archetypes for their inciting incidents and main event/climax. While you can certainly tweak or even re-work these archetypes, it's best to understand how they work and ensure that your new version of the event can bring out as much of the conflict as the typical method.

For more on this, check out our respective guides on [inciting incidents](https://thewritepractice.com/inciting-incident) and [climaxes](https://thewritepractice.com/climax-of-a-story/).

These ideas are not new, and I also have to acknowledge a huge debt to the story theorists who have gone before me, especially Blake Snyder, author of [Save the Cat](https://www.amazon.com/Save-Last-Book-Screenwriting-Youll/dp/1932907009/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=save+the+cat&qid=1633098365&sr=8-1); Robert McKee, author of [Story](https://www.amazon.com/Story-Substance-Structure-Principles-Screenwriting/dp/0060391685/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=story+Robert&qid=1633098423&sr=8-1); and Shawn Coyne, author of [Story Grid](https://www.amazon.com/Story-Grid-What-Good-Editors/dp/1936891352/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=story+grid&qid=1633098399&sr=8-1).

Bonus Type: Combine Them!

While all great stories are driven by values and the conflict between them, many stories combine plot types and/or value scales in unique ways, creating new plot types of their own.

Often this approach works best with either longer works, epics that combine many arcs into one story, or shorter works, like short stories, which may not contain all the elements of longer, more established plot types.

However, combining or rearranging plot types is considered advanced. Consider before you attempt to come up with your own completely unique plot type, especially if you are a new writer, as you risk the story not working or getting lost in the plot and failing to finish.

Remember: working with an established plot type requires just as much creativity and flair for coming up with dramatic situations as invention your own.

## Subtypes

While most popular stories will fit within the ten plot types above, you could also get more specific by exploring subtypes.

Subtypes are more specific plots with unique conventions, tropes, and characters. Examples of subtypes include revenge plots, a subtype of action plots; heist plots, a subplot of adventure stories; or obsession love stories.

Most stories that work will fall somewhere into the above plot types, and all stories that work will fall into the six value scales.

## These 9 Types of Stories Work for Any Story Arc

Great novels, films, memoirs, and plays come in many shapes, but researchers from the University of Vermont have identified six primary shapes, all of which we talk about in detail in our [story arcs guide](https://thewritepractice.com/story-arcs). 

Here are the six:

- **Rags to Riches**. Happy ending story moving from negative to positive value.
- **Riches to Rags**. Tragic story moving from positive to negative value.
- **Man in a hole**. Happy ending story moving from positive to negative and back to positive.
- **Icarus**. Tragic story moving from negative to positive and back to negative value.
- **Cinderella**. Happy ending story starting negative, moving to positive, back to negative, and finally to positive again.
- **Oedipus**. Tragic story starting positive, moving to negative, back to positive, and finally to negative at the end.

Again, we have a [full guide on the six story arcs, complete with plot diagrams, here](https://thewritepractice.com/story-arcs).

These arcs are independent of plot type.

You can have a tragic Icarus mystery story where the villain gets away. You can have a Cinderella horror story where the monster starts out bad, then seems to be nearly defeated, only to come back stronger and then finally get destroyed in the end.

Even though certain genres and plot types have tendencies toward specific plotlines, the types work independently of arc. Choose any combination of the arcs and plot types, and it will still work.

## 2 Tips About How to Use These Plot Types

How do you actually write a book with these plot types in mind? Follow these two tips:

### First, Know Your Values

Bad books, stories that don't work, don’t know what their values are.

Or they’re trying to have every single value possible.

You can’t do that if you want to tell a great story. You have to choose! If you want to master the type of story you're trying to tell, start with finding the story's value.

Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/KoetV7uMRas) that shows how one author figured out their plot type by diving into the value at the center of their story.

### Second, Focus on Conflict Between Values

You've heard your stories need conflict, but that doesn't mean more arguments and car chases.

The kind of conflict your stories need more of is between values, and the way to master any type of story is to put the story's main value in conflict with its opposite.

If you're writing an **adventure** story, that means you need to have life and death moments.

If you're writing a **thriller**, you need to have moments of life vs. fate worse than death.

If you're writing a **love** story, you need to have as many moments of negative love, of anger, disillusion, and even hatred, as you do love.

If you're writing a **sports** story, there have to be as many moments of near failure, or actual failure, as there are of success.

If you're writing a **coming-of-age** story, then you need to include moments where the growing maturity of the character is put into conflict with its opposite, immaturity.

And finally, if you're writing a **temptation** or **morality **story, then you need moments of temptation—where the character genuinely considers if they should take actions they know are wrong because of how it could benefit them or solve a greater problem.
