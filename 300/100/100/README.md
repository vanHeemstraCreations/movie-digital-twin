# 100 - Why do we tell stories?

The reason humans have always told stories (and always will) is because **we want something**.

- Maybe we want something as simple as to **stay alive**. This was one reason our long-ago ancestors told stories about surviving attacks from ferocious beasts.

- Maybe we want **love** or **belonging**, so we tell great love stories about couples destined (or doomed) to be together.

- Maybe we want to become the **best version of ourselves**. We tell stories about how people have overcome adversity, even pushed back against their narrow-minded communities, to fully self-actualize.

- Or maybe we want to tell stories about what it's like to **transcend**, to go beyond yourself and your circumstances and serve the good of the whole community, the whole world, and so we tell stories about sacrifice and great heroism.

In other words, basic story types arise from values, from the things humans want, and the great thing is, there has been a lot of research into the values humans find to be universal.
