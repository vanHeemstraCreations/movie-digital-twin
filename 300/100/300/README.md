# 300 - Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs for Storytellers

Based on "Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs for Storytellers" at https://thewritepractice.com/types-of-stories

if you think about it, every value can be distilled to six essential human values. Building off of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, these values are as follows (credit to Robert McKee and Shawn Coyne for introducing me to these concepts):

1. **Survival from Nature**. The value of life. Because if you don’t have your life, you don’t have much.
2. **Survival from Others**. Surviving crime, other people, even monsters, you could say.
3. **Love/Community**. The value of human connection.
4. **Esteem**. The value of your status and hierarchy within a community.
5. **Personal Growth**. The value of reaching your potential.
6. **Transcendence**. The value of going beyond yourself to discover a larger purpose.

Once you distill these values, you can turn these values into scales, because these values are usually in conflict with their opposite.

- Survival from Nature > Life vs. Death
- Survival from Others > Life vs. Fate Worse than Death
- Love/Community > Love vs. Hate
- Esteem > Accomplishment vs. Failure
- Personal Growth > Maturity vs. Immaturity
- Transcendence > Right vs. Wrong

In fact, it is the conflict between these values that generate the movement and change that makes the story work.

These are the same values that drive good storytelling.
