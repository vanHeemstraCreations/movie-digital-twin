# 200 - Inciting Incident

Something must happen at the very beginning of the story - an event that throws the lead character's life out of balance. That something is the **Inciting Incident**.

In the story Digital Twin, the Inciting Incident is when there is a news report that *the workload for the near future (tomorrow) will double in size!*. At the same time, the Engineer's position in the queue of the IT support line is very far from being helped, and progress is painfully slow.
