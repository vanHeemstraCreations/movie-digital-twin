# 500 - These 9 Types of Stories Work for Any Story Arc

Great novels, films, memoirs, and plays come in many shapes, but researchers from the University of Vermont have identified six primary shapes, all of which we talk about in detail in our [story arcs guide](https://thewritepractice.com/story-arcs). 

Here are the six:

- **Rags to Riches**. Happy ending story moving from negative to positive value.
- **Riches to Rags**. Tragic story moving from positive to negative value.
- **Man in a hole**. Happy ending story moving from positive to negative and back to positive.
- **Icarus**. Tragic story moving from negative to positive and back to negative value.
- **Cinderella**. Happy ending story starting negative, moving to positive, back to negative, and finally to positive again.
- **Oedipus**. Tragic story starting positive, moving to negative, back to positive, and finally to negative at the end.

Again, we have a [full guide on the six story arcs, complete with plot diagrams, here](https://thewritepractice.com/story-arcs).

These arcs are independent of plot type.

You can have a tragic Icarus mystery story where the villain gets away. You can have a Cinderella horror story where the monster starts out bad, then seems to be nearly defeated, only to come back stronger and then finally get destroyed in the end.

Even though certain genres and plot types have tendencies toward specific plotlines, the types work independently of arc. Choose any combination of the arcs and plot types, and it will still work.
