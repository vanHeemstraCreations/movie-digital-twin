# 500 - These 9 Types of Stories Work for Any Story Arc

Great novels, films, memoirs, and plays come in many shapes, but researchers from the University of Vermont have identified six primary shapes, all of which we talk about in detail in our [story arcs guide](https://thewritepractice.com/story-arcs). 

Here are the six:

- **Rags to Riches**. Happy ending story moving from negative to positive value.
- **Riches to Rags**. Tragic story moving from positive to negative value.
- **Man in a hole**. Happy ending story moving from positive to negative and back to positive.
- **Icarus**. Tragic story moving from negative to positive and back to negative value.
- **Cinderella**. Happy ending story starting negative, moving to positive, back to negative, and finally to positive again.
- **Oedipus**. Tragic story starting positive, moving to negative, back to positive, and finally to negative at the end.

Again, we have a [full guide on the six story arcs, complete with plot diagrams, here](https://thewritepractice.com/story-arcs).

These arcs are independent of plot type.

You can have a tragic Icarus mystery story where the villain gets away. You can have a Cinderella horror story where the monster starts out bad, then seems to be nearly defeated, only to come back stronger and then finally get destroyed in the end.

Even though certain genres and plot types have tendencies toward specific plotlines, the types work independently of arc. Choose any combination of the arcs and plot types, and it will still work.

## 2 Tips About How to Use These Plot Types

How do you actually write a book with these plot types in mind? Follow these two tips:

### First, Know Your Values

Bad books, stories that don't work, don’t know what their values are.

Or they’re trying to have every single value possible.

You can’t do that if you want to tell a great story. You have to choose! If you want to master the type of story you're trying to tell, start with finding the story's value.

Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/KoetV7uMRas) that shows how one author figured out their plot type by diving into the value at the center of their story.

### Second, Focus on Conflict Between Values

You've heard your stories need conflict, but that doesn't mean more arguments and car chases.

The kind of conflict your stories need more of is between values, and the way to master any type of story is to put the story's main value in conflict with its opposite.

If you're writing an **adventure** story, that means you need to have life and death moments.

If you're writing a **thriller**, you need to have moments of life vs. fate worse than death.

If you're writing a **love** story, you need to have as many moments of negative love, of anger, disillusion, and even hatred, as you do love.

If you're writing a **sports** story, there have to be as many moments of near failure, or actual failure, as there are of success.

If you're writing a **coming-of-age** story, then you need to include moments where the growing maturity of the character is put into conflict with its opposite, immaturity.

And finally, if you're writing a **temptation** or **morality **story, then you need moments of temptation—where the character genuinely considers if they should take actions they know are wrong because of how it could benefit them or solve a greater problem.
